//Day8
//
// Basic memory refresh
//memory is stored using binary // Bits: 0 or 1
//Computer optimized for bytes // 1 byte == 8 contiguous bits
//fully contiguous

//
//Addresses
// all data in the memory has an "address"
//used to locate data
//always the same - only data changes
//usually don't utilize addresses directly
// variable handle most of the work

//
//
//Offset
//Items can be located at an address using an "offset"
//Offsets begin at 0
// Represent the number of bytes away from the original address
//normally deal with indexes instead

//memory uses addresses and offsets
//addresses are permanent, data differs
//offsets can be used to "index" into some data
