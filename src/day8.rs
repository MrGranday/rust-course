//Computer optimized for bytes // 1 byte == 8 contiguous bits
//fully contiguous

//
//*Addresses*/
// all data in the memory has an "address"
//used to locate data
//always the same - only data changes
//usually don't utilize addresses directly
// variable handle most of the work

//
//
//*Offset8*/
//Items can be located at an address using an "offset"
//Offsets begin at 0
// Represent the number of bytes away from the original address
//normally deal with indexes instead

//memory uses addresses and offsets
//addresses are permanent, data differs
//offsets can be used to "index" into some data

//*Ownership */

//Programs must track memory

//Rust utilizes an "ownership" model to manage memory

// memory can either be "moved" or "borrowed"

//*Example of - Move */

// *    display_light(dull);
// 6 so there for the next time this will not run it will give you error

// *    let dull = Light::Dull;
// 2 then it moved the dull to display_light function and the ownership is moved
// *    display_light(&dull);
// 6 so there for the next time this will run it will not give you error because it was borrowed

//Rust uses "Ownership " to accomplish memory management
//the "Owner" of data must clean uo the memory
//this occurs automatically at the end of the scope
//Default behavior is to "move" memory to new owner
//Use an ampersand(&) to allow code to "borrow " memory
